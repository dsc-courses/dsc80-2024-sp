    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `project.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",
    "    * We may manually grade part of your answer to Question 4 (`argument_for_nmar`), but the rest will be fully autograded, and all you will need to submit is `project.py`.\n",
    "* **For the Checkpoint, which is required, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for Questions 1 and 2!**\n",
    "    - The \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code ‚Äì it only runs the public tests on Questions 1 and 2 to make sure that you have completed them. There are no hidden tests for the checkpoint, and you will see your score upon submission. \n",
    "    - When you submit the final version of the project, however, we will use hidden tests to check your answers more thoroughly.\n",
    "    - Note that this means you will ultimately have to submit the project twice ‚Äì once to the \"Project 2 Checkpoint\" autograder (Questions 1 and 2 only), and once to the \"Project 2\" autograder (once you're fully done).\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in `project.py` file!** The functions in `project.py` are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-sp).\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `project.py`, we've included a script named `project-validation.py` in the project folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the project, as long as they also end up in `project.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning! üö®\n",
    "\n",
    "Many questions in the project intentionally build off of each other and the final result matters! In fact, you can \"get a question correct,\" but only receive partial credit for it because a previous answer was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any questions that related with number rounding, please be aware that `np.round()` and `round()` function differently. For this assignment, use `round()` when needed as it is the function we will utilize in the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with a Partner üëØ\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate parts independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you do work with a partner, you and your partner must submit the Checkpoint together and the whole project together. See [here](https://dsc80.com/syllabus/#projects) for more details."
