    "\n",
    "1. Pick a topic of interest.\n",
    "2. Do an independent project around that topic.\n",

    "3. Put your project online as a publicly viewable webpage (like what you're doing for your final project!).\n",
    "4. Write an email that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hi {name},\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is {name} and I'm an undergrad at UCSD studying {major}.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm really interested in learning more about your research in {topic} since I'm also working on projects in that area. For example, I wrote about my latest work on {my project} here: {url}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you have some time in the next few weeks for a 30-min chat?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Email PhD students, not professors!\n",
    "    1. Most professors I know get lots of low-quality cold emails every day, so many of them just ignore. But PhD students are less famous so they'll be happy that someone is interested in their work.\n",
    "1. Keep it short. If they can't read it in 10 seconds, it's too long!\n",
    "1. Share your URL. That shows that you actually have interest in the topic.\n",
    "1. Ask for a 30-min chat (not 1 hour). Again, people are busy!\n",
    "1. If they agree to meet, don't ask to join their lab right away. Talk to them about their work, then at the end, say something like, \"Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me! This work fits really well with my interests, so I was wondering whether there might be opportunities to work with you as part of your research group.\"\n",
    "1. If they say yes, great! If they say no, ask them for other people they know who might also be a good fit."
